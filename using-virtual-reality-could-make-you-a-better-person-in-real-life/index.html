                                    <img src="./index_files/vr.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
                                    <p>If you've ever participated in a virtual reality (VR) experience, you may have found yourself navigating the virtual world as an avatar. If you have not done so, you probably recognize the experience of its representation in cinema and on television.</p>
									<p>Popular media brought us characters like Jake Sully in Avatar, Wade Watts in Ready Player One and Danny and Karl in the Black Mirror Striking Vipers episode.</p>
									<p>In these examples, the character's virtual alter-ego is physically different from what it is in the real world. The connection between the real person and their virtual avatar is called "embodiment". If you have a strong sense of embodiment when using VR, you might feel like your virtual body is your own biological body.</p>
									<p>Virtual embodiment provides an opportunity to explore the world from a different point of view. And studies have shown that experiencing new perspectives in the virtual world can alter your behaviour in real life.</p>
									<h3>How the virtual incarnation works</h3>
									<p>The virtual incarnation is not entirely new. Role playing games on PC or console generate a similar effect, although to a lesser extent. VR technology creates a much greater sense of immersion in the virtual world than two-dimensional screen experiences.</p>
									<p>Indeed, successful 3D virtual environments use more meaning than visual and audio technologies in 2D screen technologies. This approach guarantees that the user is completely engulfed in the synthetic world, which he experiences through his virtual avatar.</p>
									<p>Immersive VR visuals make the user believe that they are somewhere else, such as at the top of Mount Everest or the Eiffel Tower. By presenting separate images to each eye, a 3D effect can be obtained when the user incorporates the information from each screen into the VR headset.</p>
									<p>These visuals are captured with photographs or 360-degree video cameras. Alternatively, actual photography or video can be used in VR environments.</p>
									<p>Appropriate 360-degree sound also plays an important role as it can help convince the user of the authenticity of the virtual world.</p>
									<h3>Touch, smell and "body possession"</h3>
									<p>The sense of touch is a common form of sensory feedback. Whenever you feel your mobile phone vibrate in your pocket, you interact with "haptic" technology.</p>
									<p>In VR, haptic devices simulate physical sensations that are triggered when avatars interact with virtual objects. There are devices that can change the weight distribution or aerodynamics of an avatar to mimic what is happening in the virtual environment. Real physical accessories can also be used to introduce real challenges to VR sports. Haptic sensations can even be created in the air.</p>
									<p>Another important mechanism that improves engagement in a virtual world is smell, or smell. A Kickstarter campaign for a VR mask that can simulate smell using aroma capsules has exceeded its funding target, demonstrating the level of interest in multi-sensory VR.</p>
									<p>In addition to the additional senses, virtual reality gives the user a sense of bodily belonging to the virtual avatar. Tangible property refers to the self-attribution of a (virtual) body. This can be achieved by synchronizing several sensory feedbacks.</p>
									<p>For example, when the user can see their virtual hand touched and feel the haptic sensation at the same time, they are more likely to believe that the virtual body is their own. This is demonstrated by the famous experience of the rubber hand.</p>
									<h3>How virtual bodies affect behavior</h3>
									<p>People react differently to virtual avatars depending on who they are and the characteristics of the avatar. For example, a recent study found that women dislike their virtual avatar with male hands, while men are more likely to accept avatar hands of any gender.</p>
									<p>Another study found that racial bias decreases when Caucasians are represented by avatars who have darker skin compared to lighter skin.</p>
									<p>The body shape of the avatar also affects behavior. Researchers have found that game players show increased physical activity in the real world if they regularly play games with thin avatars, as opposed to obese.</p>
									<p>This suggests that the identities of virtual avatars may take precedence over our usual identities.</p>
									<h3>Choose the right path</h3>
									<p>The possibility of embodying a virtual avatar blurs the lines between what happens in the helmet and what happens in real life. It feeds the freedom to explore and experiment, whether with a different personality, gender or physique.</p>
									<p>But the option must be available first if it is to have an impact. PC Gamer reported this week that the developers of the medieval multiplayer game Mordhau were considering introducing female and racial skin tones into the game. The suggestion (which they deny) that they also planned to give players the option to turn off this diversity if they don't like it has led to a backlash in the gaming community.</p>
									<p>Our own research with older adults has also revealed frustration with the inflexibility of avatar creation tools, such as the inability to modify personal characteristics such as facial features and fitness levels.</p>
									<p>The embodiment is powerful. It can influence your identity, your perception and your behavior inside and outside the virtual worlds. It is the responsibility of future designers and developers of this technology to ensure that this power is used wisely.</p>
